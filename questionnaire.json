        "question": "What is serialization?",
        "answer": "<p>Packaging data for transport. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a form that can be readily transported. The <code>$.serialize()</code> method creates a text string of name/value pairs that can be sent to a server in an AJAX request. It can act on a jQuery object that has selected individual form controls, such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>: <code>$('input, textarea, select').serialize();</code>. It is typically easier, however, to select the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> itself for serialization: <code>$('#formData').serialize();</code></p>"

XML serialization does not include type information.</p><p>The biggest reason that JSON is now being used over XML is that JSON is inherently more efficient. It is lightweight, fewer bits are being transferred, and less machine time is required to process data (on either end).</p>"

For example, if you create an index on the primary key and then search for a row of data based on one of the primary key values, SQL Server first finds that value in the index, and then uses the index to quickly locate the entire row of data. Without the index, a table scan would have to be performed in order to locate the row, which can have a significant effect on performance.
